Description:
-----------
The FrontPanel project is intended to be a contribution for assisting in the preservation of
computer history.  It is a library for dynamically simulating the physical appearance of 
the front panel on historic computers.  It has methods for describing lights, switches, 
graphics elements for obtaining realistic physical appearances, and a programming interface for 
integration into a computer simulation program.

For detailed technical information please consult the user manual in the doc/ subdirectory.

This directory contains the source code for FrontPanel and examples using  
modified versions of simh for simulating the Data General Nova 1200, Nova3, Digital Computer Controls D-116.

OpenGL hardware acceleration is required.
The behavior of the lights on the front panels will be realistic.


Running the examples:
--------------------
  To run the examples, cd into the respective run directory and invoke the run script of your choice.
  Each example will result in a graphics window to be opened displaying the system, and the 
  console output will appear in the shell window from which you invoked the simulator. Quitting 
  the simulation can be accomplished by typing control-E (which is the default interrupt in simh),
  then typing 'quit'.


	  DG Nova 1200, DG Nova 3, DCC D-116 systems
	  -----------------------------------------
	  cd nova/rundir
	  consult the README file in there.
	  Invoke the run_* script of your choosing.
