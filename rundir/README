The contents of this directory consist of the run files
for simulating the Data General Nova 1200, Nova 3, and the
Digital Computer Controls (DCC) D-116 which was a Nova clone
in the 1970s.  All simulations use the 'nova' version of the
simh simulator (simh.trailing-edge.com) which is modified to
use the FrontPanel library.

Descriptions of the files and directories are as follows:
